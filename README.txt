The following program was coded from scratch for a car dealership that needed help administrating vehicles.
It was coded using inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes and overriding methods. The program allows
the user to be administrate the dealership as well as be a sells man, so many different people could potentially
use the app. The administrator side of the app allows the user to view information about the company and its' salesmen.
It also allows the user to add vehicles to the company. On the other hand, the salesman side of the program consists of
a selling and showing the clients the vehicles. The user can add clients, remove clients, and select them to proceed to
viewing their info and showing them a filtered catalog of vehicles. The clients can either buy a vehicle or add them to
their wish list where they can comeback to and purchase the selected vehicle.
